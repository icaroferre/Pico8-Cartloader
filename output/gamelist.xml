Cactus blocks are falling for some reason. You, a little frog named frog, have to jump and dodge out of their way. Set them up in lines in order to clear them off of your land. 
-Pull them with your tongue while they're green and falling.
-Turn them into dust once they're dry, yellow, and set on the ground.
Just be careful using that tongue of yours. Getting squished is easier than you think.
-Raise your acrobatics game by upgrading your jump height and tongue length every time you clear 3 lines.
-Collect all the eyes and uncover the mystery. 
-But most of all we hope you have fun!
Pullfrog is a game created by Joven Paul and Mario Carballo. Made in Pico8 over the month of June 2020. We had a ton of fun making it and we learned a lot. If you have any feedback about it, feel free to let us know! We want to balance it just right so all kinds of players can enjoy it.
-Thanks for playing</desc></game><game><name>NULL</name><path>./47637.p8.png</path><image>./media/screenshots/pico47637.png</image><developer>Jusiv</developer><desc>ABOUT:
NULL is a surreal adventure game. What you see in the end depends on what you can find on the way.
A 100% playthrough can be completed in 10-15 minutes, if you know where everything is.
This is my third full Pico-8 game (not counting stuff from game jams)! I made it over the course of November and December 2017. All assets and code are my own work.
If you want to see more of my stuff, check out my Twitter: @Jusiv_
CONTROLS:
Arrows: Move
Z/X/C: Interact
TIPS:
There are two types of things to find. Each area has exactly one of each.
Some hidden things will only appear once you've reached the end of an area.
If you get totally stuck, maybe try resting for a minute.
This won't help you progress, but maybe play this: Messages. It might be significant.

Journey across the stars, crashing your Star Cruiser into a series of increasingly dangerous, procedurally generated planets. Explore their hazardous surfaces as you rescue your stranded crew, salvage lost cargo, and zap hordes of enemies. Can you survive long enough to reach the Mysterious Planet X? Or will you be consumed by a slime, zapped by an enemy blaster, boiled in acid, or choked to death by a toxic atmosphere?
CONTROLS
Arrow Keys/Directional Pad - Move
[Z] - Jump (tap, or hold for higher jumps)
[X] - Use Held Item
[Down] + [X] - Pick up / Swap Item
SCORE
There are several ways to earn score as you traverse a planet's surface:
Bopping enemies
Zapping enemies
Securing cargo
Transporting friendly crew off the surface
Completing levels
Blasting off from the planet in a new Star Cruiser
Several secret bonuses you'll need to discover!
PLANETS
As you delve deeper into space, the planets will expand in size, add more difficult room layouts and variations, increase the chance for high gravity, unlock new hazardous biomes (including burning lava planets, sliding ice planets, and rare toxic atmospheres!), more challenging enemy variants, more enemy crew, and fewer useful items to help you along the way. While the first few planets might not cause you much trouble, by the time you reach the Mysterious Planet X, you'll need the skills and bravery of a true Space Ranger to survive!
SPECIES
Humans are boring! While they're the most common species in the Space Rangers, the other sentient species have special bonuses to help in their adventures.  Along with all the random features of each planet, you'll need to accustom yourself to the unique ability of your randomly chosen cadet.
Can you reach the Mysterious Planet X with a cadet from every species?

CHANGE LOG
---------------- v1.3 ----------------
--- GAMEPLAY ---
o  Lowered the number of screens per planet, and randomized the chance of extra screens on later planets instead of always having them be bigger, which:
1) makes the game easier
2) varies up the landscape more frequently
3) presents the player with a win feeling more often, making the game more fun overall.
o  Removed the increase in enemy hit points on later planets, as, with no visual indicator, it's confusing and not fun to discover deep into a run.
o  Removed the need to press up to enter the ship, removing the need to learn another action
o  Fixed a bug where your high score wouldn't be updated when you win the game
o  Changed screen clear score to take into account planet difficulty
o  Changed score to not be stored as decimals, as score should never get close to 32k and conversion used tokens. Forced new save version to _13, to clear old scores as this and gameplay changes make old scores meaningless.
--- VISUALS ---
o  Adjusted the HUD window size so that the full vertical play area can be seen properly
o  Added a HUD prompt when near an item, instructing the player on how to pick it up
o  Adjusted the title screen to be centered better, shifting all status displays a little higher
o  Added random flavor text dialog strings to the crash sequence
o  Added flavor text dialog strings that describe the overall difficulty of a planet upon landing
o  Added ability to specify a blood color for death particles (robots no longer bleed!)
o  Renamed the "talk-o-tron" to "tele-tron", to better match its concept
--- AUDIO ---
o  Added a sound effect when entering the ship at the end of a planet
o  Added a sound effect for the Planet: Cleared banner
--- CODE ---
o  Updated the include pico-8 package to v0.2.0i (netting some free tokens!)
o  Added back in code comments I had to remove a long time ago for .png format space and reorganized code for better readability
o  Recaptured a bunch of tokens through various methods (multiple if chains converted to "if ands", some ifs that weren&#226;&#8364;&#8482;t necessary (nil checks when nil is ok), a few missed multiple assignment lines, a few unnecessary assignments in reset() and other functions, a few never-used code paths (extensibility that was never used or generic functions that are only called in one place), and other assorted cleanups.</desc></game><game><name>GRiPPY</name><path>./grippy-5.p8.png</path><image>./media/screenshots/pico8_grippy-5.png</image><developer>ivy</developer><desc>CONTROLS

Transport passengers to their destination.
Watch the world go by.
Listen to chilled out chiptune music.
In Cab Ride you can drive thousands of different train routes through rolling hills, winding tunnels and weaving between the tall buildings of vast cities. You can drive the train for as long as you like. When you're ready to end your journey, hold down the left arrow key to announce the last station. Stopping at stations along the way means you can pick up and drop off passengers. Try and stop at the marker at each station for a high rating. Or don't! It's up to you.
Cab Ride is a casual train simulation, not aiming for real world accuracy, but like a real train, it takes a while to brake. If you're overshooting stations, watch for the alert for the next station and reduce the throttle so you're ready to stop.
Controls
X - horn/start/restart the game
C - open/close doors at station (must have stopped just in front of signal)
Up - increase braking/decrease throttle
Down - accelerate/increase throttle
Left - hold down to announce the last station (will end the current journey)
Right - turn Express mode on/off aka Screensaver Mode
Version history
v1.1
Added - second track with train
Added - Weather - different cloud patterns and periods of rain
More performance fixes 
v1.0.3
Changed - tweaked station stop ratings - slightly more forgiving and more consistent
Changed - all green signals when you're in express mode (after first couple of stations)
Fixed - all passengers would eventually get off if you opened the doors enough times at a single station
Various performance improvements
v1.0.2
Added - pause menu sound toggle - deals with no hardware button in mobile view - may fix in a different way in future
Added - 'very chilled' mode - no goal/help messages, no HUD other than station name messages, just driving trains - good for screenshots or screen savers (even better than what I claimed was a good screen saver mode before)
Fixed - another way to drive through the last station (activate Express mode after announcing last station)
v1.0.1
Fixed - crash bug where you could drive out of the last station when in 'Express' mode
Changed - you now have to hold down the right key for 2 seconds to enable Express mode (announcing the last stop also has a 2 second delay) - this is to prevent ending up in that mode by accident and locking the controls
v1.0

ABOUT
This is a short but sweet game about trekking through the woods to make a special delivery.
This was made over parts of October and December 2020 for the PICO-8 Advent Calendar 2020. It was a great excuse for me to finally dig into some of the newer PICO-8 features added since my last big project, particularly tline and oval drawing.
Special thanks to thattomhall for playtesting and freds72 for providing me his textured polygon function! (It is used with minor modifications for drawing various elements of the house.)
And if you'd like to follow my work, check out my Twitter: @Jusiv_
UPDATE 1/5/2021: By popular request I've added a checkpoint to the lake!
I did increase the difficulty of the end portion a little to compensate, but it should still be less punishing overall.</desc></game><game><name>warehouse panic</name><path>./46990.p8.png</path><image>./media/screenshots/pico46990.png</image><developer>benjamin_soule</developer><desc>Here's my entry for ludum dare 40.

Released at DiHalt 2021 demoparty (https://events.retroscene.org/dh2021)
Creating ST NICCC clones on all possible platforms is a demoscene challenge. The original demo uses a 640KB data file. A single PICO-8 cartridge can fit only about 12KB of arbitrary data. To fit the whole 3D scene in a single cartridge, we re-created it with 3D models. In my opinion, finding clever solutions to overcome platform limitations and do what seemed to be impossible to do is the essence of the old-school demoscene.

- - - ABOUT - - - 
So right after I finished my first released game, Messages, I decided that I wanted to try and make an RPG in Pico-8. Well, about a month and a half later, this is what that project became.
This thing barely fits on a cart, using almost 8192 tokens, each of the 64 available sounds, and basically all of the sprite and texture data.
Oh, and I did what I could with the soundtrack, but I'm not a musician so I can't promise anything about it's quality.

 - - - COMBAT - - - 
You have three basic types of skills you can use in combat: Attacks, Spells, and Actions. In order to use a skill, you will have to perform a quick minigame to determine its effectiveness. As you level up, you will unlock more skills.
Attacks and Spells are offensive. The base damage they deal is determined by how well you execute their minigame, but the final damage dealt is also affected by the enemy's defense against the chosen type of skill. Higher-tier Attacks and Spells are more powerful, but also harder to execute.
To perform an Attack, you will have to stop a series of moving sliders on the highlighted sections using Z/X.
To perform a Spell, you will have to quickly sort a series of runes by color (orange or blue). If they're orange, hit Left, and if they're blue hit Right.
Actions are defensive, and there are only two available: Flee and Recover. Flee exits a battle (if executed correctly), while Recover restores up to half of your maximum health and can cure status effects if performed well enough.
To perform Flee, rapidly hit the button shown. Pay attention, since the required button may change after each successful press!
To perform Recover, you have to keep a meter balanced in the center using Left and Right. The amount of health restored will vary depending on your maximum HP and how effectively you executed the minigame. If you get an Amazing or Epic rating, it will also cure any status effect you have! Recover has a 2-turn cooldown.
Lastly, there are three status effects which enemies can give you: Poison, Dizzy, and Panic.
Poison deals damage over time.
Dizzy has a chance to halve your base damage when you use an Attack or a Spell.
Panic makes minigames harder to execute.

Hello, Everyone!!
This is my first game... in PICO-8.
The game is about Kelin who has a job to deliver a package to her client. However, rain comes and Kelin has to stay in an unused old house because the path to cave is blocked. She is also hungry. Help Kelin find food and something to rid the cave block in the old house with adventure gameplay mechanic!
As mentioned, the gameplay genre is Adventure. Player inspects environment, get items, combine items, use item on something, and win the game.
Feedbacks are welcome!

The hard part when making this game was making content and shrinking the code to fit the tool restriction. Token and character restrictions were easy, but the compressed size restriction was the hardest. I didn't aware of the compressed size restriction which made me accidentally put too many texts. In the end, I managed to fit the size from nearly 20000 bytes into 15360 bytes. For any future PICO-8 game dev who are planning to put a lot of text in the game, pay a lot of attention to compressed size restriction.

Gameplay
Crowded Dungeon Crawler is a mix of puzzle and dungeon crawler. Your goal is to defeat enough enemies to open the door to the next level.
The TIME bar depletes as you play. Once it's empty it's game over. Attacking enemies and buying items will stop time for a few seconds.
Melee items require HP to be used. When attacking multiple enemies, only the strongest one in the group will damage you.
Magic items require MANA. Each item has a specific mana cost. If you don't have enough mana to cast an ability, you can hold the attack button to convert TIME into MANA.
You can have up to 7 items in your INVENTORY. If you pick up more than that, you will drop the currently equipped item on the ground.
Defeat enough enemies to open the EXIT. If you clear ALL enemies you will receive an additional reward.
Pause Menu
The pause menu has some special options:
If you don't have any plays left, select RESTART LEVEL to try again.
Select REPLAY PUZZLES to play previous puzzles in which you didn't collect the golden gem.
CLEAR PROGRESS will restart the game from the beginning but keep your scores.
CLEAR SCORE will erase your scores but keep your progress on the puzzles.
You can't interact with the pause menu with  the mouse, only with the keyboard or controller.
Puzzle Levels
Each world consists of 7 puzzles and a sequence of random levels at the end. In puzzle levels, you have to defeat enough enemies before running out of resources. If you don't have any more health, mana, or items to use, pause the game and select RESTART LEVEL.
Puzzle levels have some specific rules:
In puzzle mode, your TIME bar doesn't deplete unless you use a magic item to convert time into mana.
Clearing all enemies will give you a GOLDEN GEM. Golden gems are used to unlock playable classes.
Adventure Mode
In world 6 there are no puzzle levels. Instead, you can play with different classes in an endless sequence of levels for high scores. It only ends when you run out of time.
Clearing all enemies gives you a RED GEM. Red gems can be used at special shops for unique items. If you keep them, they count as much as 100 coins!
Each class has its own score counter. Try to see how far you can go with each one!
Every 3 levels the dungeon type changes. You can see what's the next type on the STAIRS!
Destroy the GOLDEN IDOL to double your score! Defeating the golden idol ends your run. Try to defeat it only when you think you can't go any further!
After each level, some of your resources (HP, mana and items) will be refilled according to your class.
Items and Enemies
You should be able to figure out the item and enemy mechanics on your own. In case you get stuck here is some additional information. SPOILERS!

Hi!
I had a go at the Disc Room game jam, and ended up building a Super Crate Box / Disc Room hybrid. The sfx were made between 2am and 4am so they're a little rough, but otherwise I think it came out okay. Anyhow, this is my first full size PICO-8 game so I'd love to hear what you think!

There is no time constraint, no danger, there's no gameover. Instead, this game proposes a calming experience of exploration and encounters. You can just stop playing when you feel satisfied. A play session will usually last 15 to 30 minutes.

Thanks to  @dw817 for finding it!)
So, here it is, my first ever fully completed cart. I have a real bad habit of starting lots of things and never finishing them, and this was destined to be just another one of those things. I started work on this about a month or two ago, and did most of the work back then. I decided I needed a bit of a break from my current project and thought, hey, why don't I go back and finish this?
I've learned a lot since then, and generally improved a bunch, so most of this code is a mess, and doesn't use things it really should like objects, but, everything functions well enough at least. It's super unoptimized though, mostly because I was under the assumption there was no CPU limitations in Pico-8, and going back to finish it up, I didn't really bother fixing that. The particle system is my own, written for the main cart I've been working on, but the background previously was a stolen tweetcart (the function was even called "stolentweetcart()") I was using as a placeholder. It was distracting anyway, so I replaced it with the particles and used them to make a few other things nicer as well. 
The main goal here was to make it compliant to the 2009 Tetris guideline (a big document the Tetris company uses that says exactly how a Tetris game should be made) though I disregarded that going back to it, so it's halfway or so there. Also, SRS isn't implemented properly, it's good enough but it's not perfect, and the title is a typo I thought was funny so I rolled with it.
Anyway, enough of my rambling, hope you enjoy!

The goal is to reach level 15 by clearing 450 blocks. If the board fills up you lose.
You clear blocks in 2 ways:
getting 3 or more blocks of the same color in a straight line
putting 4 blocks of the same color together to make a diamond
Controls
&#11013;&#65039;/&#10145;&#65039; 
move current quad left or right
&#11015;&#65039; 
hard drop current quad to the bottom of the board
&#10062; (z/c/n)
rotate counter clockwise
&#127358;&#65039; (x/v/m) 
rotate clockwise
Press &#10062; + &#127358;&#65039; to start the game!
Playing on mobile
If you're playing on mobile, I recommend swapping the rotation buttons with the inverse rotation pause menu option.
Drop shadow
Some players find the falling block shadow confusing. If you would rather turn it off, you can toggle whether it displays with "hide shadow" and "show shadow" in the pause menu.
Links
The full code (broken up into multiple files for readability) is available on github here.
If you're curious, you can follow the development progress on twitter.
Finally, if you like this, please go check out the original Mixolumia. It's gorgeous, juicy, addictive, and relaxing, and the dynamic soundtrack is absolutely amazing. Plus it uses the PICO-8 color palette!

Well, here it is now! This is the minified version, but the .p8 source is available on the itch.io page: https://krajzeg.itch.io/low-knight.
The game is a demake of and a homage to Hollow Knight. It was made in 6 days, so it's kind of rough around the edges, and the difficulty level is over the top. It is what it is, though, and still happy with how well it holds up given its development time :)</desc></game><game><name>Stuck in the Sewers</name><path>./stuck_in_the_sewers-6.p8.png</path><image>./media/screenshots/pico8_stuck_in_the_sewers-6.png</image><developer>BoneVolt</developer><desc>Mr. Mouse wants to go to the beach in his vacation, but got stuck in a maze of pipes.
